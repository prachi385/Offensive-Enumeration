**GitHub Subdomains GitHub Repository**

`github-subdomains` is a tool developed by [gwen001](https://github.com/gwen001) that searches GitHub repositories for subdomains related to a given target domain. This is useful for:

- Discovering exposed subdomains in public GitHub repositories.
- Finding assets that developers might have accidentally leaked.
- Gathering more intelligence for security assessments.

---

## Installation

To install `github-subdomains`, use:

```bash
go install github.com/gwen001/github-subdomains@latest
```

> Ensure Go is installed and properly configured before running this command.

---

## Usage

### Displaying Help Information

To view available options and flags:

```bash
github-subdomains -h
```

---

### Finding Subdomains for a Target Domain

To search for subdomains associated with `example.com`, using a list of GitHub tokens:

```bash
github-subdomains -d example.com -t tokens.txt -o output.txt
```

#### Explanation of Flags:

- `-d example.com` → Specifies the target domain.
- `-t tokens.txt` → Uses API tokens for authenticated GitHub searches (improves results and avoids rate limiting).
- `-o output.txt` → Saves the extracted subdomains to a file.

## Finding Subdomains for Tesla

For a real-world example using Tesla:

```bash
github-subdomains -d tesla.com -t github-tokens.txt -o tesla.com-github-subdomains-output.txt
```

This will extract any subdomains related to `tesla.com` found in public GitHub repositories.

---

## Example Output

If you run:

```bash
github-subdomains -d tesla.com -t github-tokens.txt -o tesla.com-github-subdomains-output.txt
```

The output might contain subdomains like:

```
api.tesla.com  
dev.tesla.com  
staging.tesla.com  
internal.tesla.com
```

These subdomains might have been found in public GitHub repositories due to accidental exposure.

## Importance of Using GitHub Tokens

GitHub has strict rate limits for unauthenticated searches. To maximize results, use personal access tokens stored in a file (`tokens.txt`). You can generate GitHub tokens from:

👉 [GitHub Token Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### Recommended scopes for the token:

- `repo`
- `read:public_key`
- `read:org`

## Conclusion

`github-subdomains` is an effective tool for uncovering subdomains leaked in GitHub repositories. When combined with other enumeration tools, it provides a comprehensive reconnaissance strategy.
